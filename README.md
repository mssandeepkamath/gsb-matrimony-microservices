## Project Overview

The GSB Matrimony Microservices project is designed to cater to the specific needs of the GSB community for matrimony purposes. It includes multiple microservices that handle various functionalities, such as user authentication, matchmaking, communication, and more. The project uniquely integrates Melameli assessment and direct communication with respected priests (Bhatmaams), offering a comprehensive and culturally enriched matrimonial experience for the GSB community.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Profile Management:** Register and manage user accounts with profile information.
- **Verification and Matchmaking:** Verify GSB community identity and implement matchmaking algorithms.
- **Communication and Messaging:** Facilitate user communication, messaging, and contact sharing.
- **Priest Communication:** Enable users to communicate with priests for guidance.
- **Melameli Logic:** Determine melameli (marriage suitability) based on astrological factors.
- **Payment and Subscription:** Manage subscription plans and payment processing.
- **Search and Recommendation:** Provide search options and personalized recommendations.
- **Notifications:** Send email and in-app notifications for important updates.
- **Image and File Storage:** Handle storage of user photos and documents.
- **API Gateway and Configuration:** Serve as an entry point for microservices and handle routing.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GSB Matrimony Microservices project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mssandeepkamath/gsb-matrimony-microservices.git`
2. Navigate to each microservice folder and follow the README instructions to build and run.
